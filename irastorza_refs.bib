    abstract = {We have recently read the article entitled ‘Impact of dispersive patch electrode placement on the safety and efficacy of catheter radiofrequency ablation’, a point of view of Futyma et al.1 The authors state that ‘when the dispersive patch electrodes (DPEs) are placed incorrectly, it can lead to suboptimal lesion formation and potentially increase the risk of adverse events’. However, they do not provide any solid reference to support this claim, and in fact, there is hardly any current evidence on this issue.In our previous studies based on computational models, we did not observe a significant clinical impact of changing the DPE position on lesion size.2,3 Futyma et al. cite our two previous works and emphasize some of the limitations of our methodology. However, contrary to what the authors claim, (i) we did compute the lesion depth including extracardiac structures such as lung, connective tissue, and bones and (ii) the conductivity and resistivity of the lungs was taken from a recognized database, which interestingly is the same one used in a recent study based on computer modelling which is indeed well regarded by Futyma et al. for presenting results in line with their point of view.},

    abstract = { To use computational modeling to provide a complete and logical description of the electrical and thermal behavior during stereoelectroencephalography-guided (SEEG) radiofrequency thermo­coagulation (RF-TC). A coupled electrical-thermal model was used to obtain the temperature distributions in the tissue during RF-TC. The computer model was first validated by an ex vivo model based on liver fragments and later used to study the impact of three different factors on the coagulation zone size: 1) the difference in the tissue surrounding the electrode (gray/white matter), 2) the presence of a peri-electrode gap occupied by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and 3) the energy setting used (power-duration). The model built for the experimental validation was able to predict both the evolution of impedance and the short diameter of the coagulation zone (error \&lt; 0.01 mm) reasonably well but overestimated the long diameter by 2 − 3 mm. After adapting the model to clinical conditions, the simulation showed that: 1) Impedance roll-off limited the coagulation size but involved overheating (around 100 °C); 2) The type of tissue around the contacts (gray vs. white matter) had a moderate impact on the coagulation size (maximum difference 0.84 mm), and 3) the peri-electrode gap considerably altered the temperature distributions, avoided overheating, although the diameter of the coagulation zone was not very different from the no-gap case (\&lt;0.2 mm). This study showed that computer modeling, especially subject- and scenario-specific modeling, can be used to estimate in advance the electrical and thermal performance of the RF-TC in brain tissue. }

abstract = {Abstract An epicardial approach is often used in radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation to ablate ventricular tachycardia when an endocardial approach fails. Our objective was to analyze the effect of the position of the dispersive patch (DP) on lesion size using computer modeling during epicardial approach. We compared the posterior position (patient's back), commonly used in clinical practice, to the anterior position (patient's chest). The model considered ventricular wall thicknesses between 4 and 8 mm, and electrode insertion depths between .3 and .7 mm. RF pulses were simulated with 20 W of power for 30 s duration. Statistically significant differences (P < .001) were found between both DP positions in terms of baseline impedance, RF current (at 15 s) and thermal lesion size. The anterior position involved lower impedance (130.8 ± 4.7 vs. 146.2 ± 4.9 Ω) and a higher current (401.5 ± 5.6 vs. 377.5 ± 5.1 mA). The anterior position created lesion sizes larger than the posterior position: 8.9 ± 0.4 vs. 8.4 ± 0.4 mm in maximum width, 8.6 ± 0.4 vs. 8.1 ± 0.4 mm in surface width, and 4.5 ± 0.4 vs. 4.3 ± 0.4 mm in depth. Our results suggest that: (1) the redirection of the RF currents due to repositioning the PD has little impact on lesion size and only affects baseline impedance, and (2) the differences in lesion size are only 0.5 mm wider and 0.2 mm deeper for the anterior position, which does not seem to have a clinical impact in the context of VT ablation.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: The electrical conductivity of trabecular bone at 100 kHz has recently been reported as a good predictor of bone volume fraction. However, quantifying its relationship with free water (or physiological solution) content and the conductivities of its constituents is still difficult. Methods: In this contribution, in silico models inspired by microCT images of trabecular bovine samples were used to build realistic geometries. The finite element method was applied to solve the electrical problem and to robustly fit the conductivity of the constituents to the literature data. The obtained effective electrical conductivity was compared with the Bruggeman three-medium mixture model using a physiological solution, bone marrow and a bone matrix. Results: The values for the physiological solution plus bone marrow (together as one material) and the bone matrix that best captured the bone volume fraction in the two-medium finite element model were σps+bm = 298.4 mS/m and σb = 21.0 mS/m, respectively. Additionally, relatively good results were obtained with the three-medium Bruggeman mixture model, with σbm= 103 mS/m, σb= 21.0 mS/m and σps= 1200 mS/m. Simple linear relationships between the proportions of constituents depending on bone volume fraction were tested. Degree of anisotropy and fractal dimension do not show detectable changes in effective conductivity. Conclusions: These results provided some useful findings for simulation purposes. First, a higher value for the electrical conductivity of bone marrow has to be used in order to obtain similar values to those of experimental published data. Second, anisotropy is not detectable with conductivity measurements for small trabecular samples (5 mm cube). Finally, the simulations presented here showed relatively good fitting of the Bruggeman mixture model, which would potentially account for the free water content and could rescale the model for whole-bone electrical simulations.},

For anterior right ventricular (RV) ablation, an anterior DP location resulted in slightly higher proportion of power delivered to the myocardium and lower baseline impedance leading to slightly larger RFCA lesions (0.6 mm deeper and 0.8 mm wider).An anterior vs. posterior DP location will not meaningfully affect RFCA for posterior left atrial ablation, and the slightly larger lesions predicted with anterior DP location for anterior RV ablation are of unclear clinical significance.},

RF-induced coagulation zones were created on ex vivo and in\&nbsp;vivo porcine models. Computer modeling was used to determine the RF power distribution in the saline-linked device. Both external (irrigation) and internal cooling effectively prevented tissue sticking. Under ex vivo conditions in ‘painting’ application mode, coagulation depth increased with the applied power: 2.8 − 5.6 mm with the 3-mm monopolar electrode, 1.6 − 6.0 mm with the 5-mm monopolar electrode and 0.6 − 3.2 mm with the saline-linked bipolar electrodes. Under in\&nbsp;vivo conditions and using spot applications, the 3-mm monopolar electrode created coagulation zones of similar depth to the saline-linked bipolar electrodes (around 3 mm), while the 5-mm monopolar electrode created deeper coagulations (4.5 − 6 mm) with less incidence of popping. The presence of saline around the saline-linked bipolar electrodes meant that a significant percentage of RF power (50 − 80\%) was dissipated by heating in the saline layer. Coagulation zones were histologically similar for all the tested devices. Both external (irrigation) and internal cooling in hemostatic RF devices effectively prevent tissue sticking and create similar coagulation zones from a histological point of view. Overall, saline-linked bipolar electrodes tend to create shallower coagulations than those created with an internally cooled monopolar electrode. }

    ABSTRACT = {Background: Baseline impedance, radiofrequency current, and impedance drop during radiofrequency catheter ablation are thought to predict effective lesion formation. However, quantifying the contributions of local versus remote impedances provides insights into the limitations of indices using those parameters. Methods: An in silico model of left atrial radiofrequency catheter ablation was used based on human thoracic measurements and solved for (1) initial impedance (Z), (2) percentage of radiofrequency power delivered to the myocardium and blood (3) total radiofrequency current, (4) impedance drop during heating, and (5) lesion size after a 25 W–30 s ablation. Remote impedance was modeled by varying the mixing ratio between skeletal muscle and fat. Local impedance was modeled by varying insertion depth of the electrode (ID). Results: Increasing the remote impedance led to increased baseline impedance, lower system current delivery, and reduced lesion size. For ID = 0.5 mm, Z ranged from 115 to 132 Ω when fat percentage varied from 20 to 80%, resulting in a decrease in the RF current from 472 to 347 mA and a slight decrease in lesion size from 5.6 to 5.1 mm in depth, and from 9.2 to 8.0 mm in maximum width. In contrast, increasing the local impedance led to lower system current but larger lesions. For a 50% fat–muscle mixture, Z ranged from 118 to 138 Ω when ID varied from 0.3 to 1.9 mm, resulting in a decrease in the RF current from 463 to 443 mA and an increase in lesion size, from 5.2 up to 7.5 mm in depth, and from 8.4 up to 11.6 mm in maximum width. In cases of nearly identical Z but different contributions of local and remote impedance, markedly different lesions sizes were observed despite only small differences in RF current. Impedance drop better predicted lesion size (R2 > 0.93) than RF current (R2 < 0.1). Conclusions: Identical baseline impedances and observed RF currents can lead to markedly different lesion sizes with different relative contributions of local and remote impedances to the electrical circuit. These results provide mechanistic insights into the advantage of measuring local impedance and identifies potential limitations of indices incorporating baseline impedance or current to predict lesion quality.},

    abstract = {Background and objectives
    Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) ablation has been proposed as a non-thermal energy to treat atrial fibrillation (AF) by ablation of ganglionated plexi using the epicardial approach. The electric field distribution at the target site (heart) and its surroundings has not yet been assessed previously, using epicardial ablation technique. Our objective was to develop computational models, incorporating the real anatomy of the heart and the patient's torso, to assess the electric field distribution when applying epicardial monopolar PEF.
    Methods
    A novel 3D realistic full torso model was built with the multi-electrode ablation device placed on the epicardium and a dispersive pad on the patient's back to evaluate the electric field distribution. The 400 V/cm isoline was used to estimate the ‘PEF-zone’. A 3D limited-domain model was also built including only the region of interest around the ablation device to assess its validity in comparison with the full torso model.
    Results
    The electrical field is mainly limited to the target site (PEF-zone with lengths of 25.79 to 29.00 mm, depths of 5.98−7.02 mm and maximum widths of 8.75−10.57 mm) and is practically negligible in adjacent organs (<30 V/cm and <36 V/cm in oesophagus and lungs, respectively). The electrical currents ranged from 3.67 A to 7.44 A. The 3D limited-domain model provided a similar electric field distribution to those obtained from the 3D full torso models (differences < 0.5 mm in PEF-zone depth).
    Conclusions
    Computational results suggest that PEF-zone is very focused around the ablation catheter. Limited-domain models offer similar results in terms of PEF-zone size, reducing the complexity of the modelling.}

    abstract = {Abstract Introduction During radiofrequency ablation (RFA) using conventional RFA catheters (RFC), ~90\% of the energy dissipates into the bloodstream/surrounding tissue. We hypothesized that a novel insulated-tip ablation catheter (SMT) capable of blocking the radiofrequency path may focus most of the energy into the targeted tissue while utilizing reduced power and irrigation. Methods This study evaluated the outcomes of RFA using SMT versus an RFC in silico, ex vivo, and in vivo. Radiofrequency applications were delivered over porcine myocardium (ex vivo) and porcine thigh muscle preparations superfused with heparinized blood (in vivo). Altogether, 274 radiofrequency applications were delivered using SMT (4–15 W, 2 or 20 ml/min) and 74 applications using RFC (30 W, 30 ml/min). Results RFA using SMT proved capable of directing 66.8\% of the radiofrequency energy into the targeted tissue. Accordingly, low power–low irrigation RFA using SMT (8–12 W, 2 ml/min) yielded lesion sizes comparable with RFC, whereas high power–high irrigation (15 W, 20 ml/min) RFA with SMT yielded lesions larger than RFC (p < .05). Although SMT was associated with greater impedance drops ex vivo and in vivo, ablation using RFC was associated with increased charring/steam pop/tissue cavitation (p < .05). Lastly, lesions created with SMT were more homogeneous than RFC (p < .001). Conclusion Low power–low irrigation (8–12 W, 2 ml/min) RFA using the novel SMT ablation catheter can create more uniform, but comparable-sized lesions as RFC with reduced charring/steam pop/tissue cavitation. High power–high irrigation (15 W, 20 ml/min) RFA with SMT yields lesions larger than RFC.},

    abstract = { Stellate ganglion (SG) block by thermal radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is frequently conducted as a therapeutic intervention for sympathetic-maintained and neuropathic pain syndromes. RFA’s partial lack of effectiveness could be partly due to the ablation zone (AZ) not completely covering the SG section and therefore preventing the ‘cutting’ of the afferent pathways. Our objective was to build a theoretical model to conduct computer simulations to assess the effect of the electrode position relative to the SG. A three-dimensional model was built including the SG and adjacent tissues (vertebrae C7-T1-T2, trachea, carotid artery and vertebral artery). RFA (90-s, 80 °C) was simulated considering a 22 G-5 mm electrode. The AZ was computed using the 50 °C isotherm. An electrode displacement of 2 mm in any direction from the optimal position (centered on the SG) meant that the AZ did not fully cover the SG section. Likewise, SG size considerably affected the RFA effectiveness since the AZ fully covered the section of small but not large SGs. The findings suggest that the currently used SG RFA settings (i.e., 22 G-5 mm electrode, 90-s, 80 °C) may not be appropriate due to their inability to achieve an AZ that fully covers the SG cross section under certain circumstances, such as a large SG and non-optimal positioning of the RF electrode with respect to the SG center. }

        abstract = {  Most modeling studies on radiofrequency cardiac ablation (RFCA) are based on limited-domain models, which means the computational domain is restricted to a few centimeters of myocardium and blood around the active electrode. When mimicking constant power RFCA procedures (e.g., atrial fibrillation ablation) it is important to know how much power is absorbed around the active electrode and how much in the rest of the tissues before reaching the dispersive electrode.  3D thorax full models were built by progressively incorporating different organs and tissues with simplified geometries (cardiac chamber, cardiac wall, subcutaneous tissue and skin, spine, lungs and aorta). Other 2D limited-domain models were also built based on fragments of myocardium and blood. The electrical problem was solved for each model to estimate the spatial power distribution around the active electrode.  From 79 to 82\% of the power was absorbed in a 4 cm-radius sphere around the active electrode in the full thorax model at active electrode insertion depths of between 0.5 and 2.5 mm, while the impedance values ranged from 104 to 118 Ω, which were consistent with those found (from 83 to 103 Ω) in a 4 cm radius cylindrical limited domain model.  The applied power in limited-domain RFCA models is approximately 80\% of that applied in full thorax models, which is equivalent to the power programed in a clinical setting. }

    abstract = {The bone quality is associated with changes in its dielectric properties (permittivity and conductivity). The feasibility of detecting changes in these properties was evaluated by using a tomographic array of 16 monopole antennas with z-polarized microwaves at 1.3 GHz. The direct electromagnetic problem was solved computationally with the finite–difference–time–domain (FDTD) method. Local and global sensitivity analyses were implemented for identifying the parameters that most affect the detection. Magnitude and phase of the transmission coefficient of the antennas were evaluated separately. It was observed that the direct problem is highly sensitive to the dielectric properties of the tissues surrounding the calcaneus and to those of the calcaneus itself. Global and local sensitivity methods have shown evidence for feasible detection of variations in dielectric properties of the bone supporting the simplification of considering only two homogeneous media (calcaneus and surrounding tissue).}

Replacing marrow by phosphate-buffered saline (defatting) increased both the computer simulations and measurement results by 0.04 W m−1 K−1. The computer simulations showed that k increases by 0.02–0.04 W m−1 K−1 when the model includes a gap filled by phosphate-buffered saline between the tissue and measurement probe. In the presence of microstructure and fatty red marrow, k varies by ± 0.01 W m−1 K−1 compared with the case considering matrix only, which suggests that there are no significant differences between cortical and trabecular bone in terms of k. The computer results showed that the presence of a gap filled by phosphate-buffered saline around the energy applicator changes maximum temperature by < 0.7 °C, while including the bone microstructure involved a variation of < 0.2 mm in the isotherm location. Future experimental studies on measuring the value of k involving the insertion of a probe into the bone through a drill hole should consider the bias found in the simulations.

    abstract = {Abstract Introduction The use of ultra-short RF pulses could achieve greater lesion depth immediately after the application of the pulse due to thermal latency. Methods and results A computer model of irrigated-catheter RF ablation was built to study the impact of thermal latency on the lesion depth. The results showed that the shorter the RF pulse duration (keeping energy constant), the greater the lesion depth during the cooling phase. For instance, after a 10-second pulse, lesion depth grew from 2.05 mm at the end of the pulse to 2.39 mm (17\%), while after an ultra-short RF pulse of only 1 second the extra growth was 37\% (from 2.22 to 3.05 mm). Importantly, short applications resulted in deeper lesions than long applications (3.05 mm vs. 2.39 mm, for 1- and 10-second pulse, respectively). While shortening the pulse duration produced deeper lesions, the associated increase in applied voltage caused overheating in the tissue: temperatures around 100 °C were reached at a depth of 1 mm in the case of 1- and 5-second pulses. However, since the lesion depth increased during the cooling period, lower values of applied voltage could be applied in short durations in order to obtain lesion depths similar to those in longer durations while avoiding overheating. Conclusion The thermal latency phenomenon seems to be the cause of significantly greater lesion depth after short-duration high-power RF pulses. Balancing the applied total energy when the voltage and duration are changed is not the optimal strategy since short pulses can also cause overheating.},

Our objective was thus to quantify the differences in the minor radius of the coagulation zone computed by including and ignoring the cooling phase. We built models of RF tumor ablation with 2 needle-like electrodes: a dry electrode (5 mm long and 17G in diameter) with a constant temperature protocol (70°C) and a cooled electrode (30 mm long and 17G in diameter) with a protocol of impedance control. We observed that the computed coagulation zone dimensions were always underestimated when the cooling phase was ignored. The mean values of the differences computed along the electrode axis were always lower than 0.15 mm for the dry electrode and 1.5 mm for the cooled electrode, which implied a value lower than 5\% of the minor radius of the coagulation zone (which was 3 mm for the dry electrode and 30 mm for the cooled electrode). The underestimation was found to be dependent on the tissue characteristics: being more marked for higher values of specific heat and blood perfusion and less marked for higher values of thermal conductivity.},

    abstract = {A quaternionic representation of the genetic code, previously reported by the authors (BioSystems 141 (10–19), 2016), is updated in order to incorporate chirality of nucleotide bases and amino acids. The original representation associates with each nucleotide base a prime integer quaternion of norm 7 and involves a function that assigns to each codon, represented by three of these quaternions, another integer quaternion (amino acid type quaternion). The assignation is such that the essentials of the standard genetic code (particularly its degeneration) are preserved. To show the advantages of such a quaternionic representation we have designed an algorithm to go from the primary to the tertiary structure of the protein. The algorithm uses, besides of the type quaternions, a second kind of quaternions with real components that we additionally associate with the amino acids according to their order along the proteins (order quaternions). In this context, we incorporate chirality in our representation by observing that the set of eight integer quaternions of norm 7 can be partitioned into a pair of subsets of cardinality four each with their elements mutually conjugate and by putting them into correspondence one to one with the two sets of enantiomers (D and L) of the four nucleotide bases adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil, respectively. We then propose two diagrams in order to describe the hypothetical evolution of the genetic codes corresponding to both of the chiral systems of affinities: D-nucleotide bases/L-amino acids and L-nucleotide bases/D-amino acids at reading frames 5′→3′ and 3′→5′, respectively. Guided by these diagrams we define functions that in each case assign to the triplets of D- (L-) bases a L- (D-) amino acid type integer quaternion. Specifically, the integer quaternion associated with a given D-amino acid is the conjugate of that one corresponding to the enantiomer L. The chiral type quaternions obtained for the amino acids are used, together with a common set of order quaternions, to describe the folding of the two classes, L and D, of homochiral proteins.}

        abstract = { Purpose: The aim was to study by computer simulations the insulating role of the reactive zone surrounding a cortical osteoid osteoma (OO) in terms of electrical and thermal performance during radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Material and methods: We modelled a cortical OO consisting of a nidus (10 mm diameter) enclosed by a reactive zone. The OO was near a layer of cortical bone 1.5 mm thick. Trabecular bone partially surrounds the OO and there was muscle around the cortical bone layer. We modelled RF ablations with a non-cooled-tip 17-gauge needle electrode (300 s duration and 90 °C target temperature). Sensitivity analyses were conducted assuming a reactive zone electrical conductivity value (σrz) within the limits of the cortical and trabecular bone, i.e. 0.02 S/m and 0.087 S/m, respectively. In this way we were really modelling the different degrees of osteosclerosis associated with the reactive zone. Results: The presence of the reactive zone drastically reduced the maximum temperature reached outside it. The temperature drop was proportional to the thickness of the reactive zone: from 68 °C when it was absent to 44 °C when it is 7.5 mm thick. Higher nidus conductivity values (σn) implied higher temperatures, while lower temperatures meant higher σrz values. Changing σrz from 0.02 S/m to 0.087 S/m reduced lesion diameters from 2.4 cm to 1.8 cm. Conclusions: The computer results suggest that the reactive zone plays the role of insulator in terms of reducing the temperature in the surrounding area. }

It incorporates, in a way that resembles the energy levels of an atom, the physical notion of broken symmetry and it is consistent with original ideas by Crick on the origin and evolution of the code as well as with the chronological order of appearance of the amino acids along the evolution as inferred from work that mixtures known experimental results with theoretical speculations. Suggested by the diagram we propose a Hamilton quaternions based mathematical representation of the code as it stands now-a-days. The central object in the description is a codon function that assigns to each amino acid an integer quaternion in such a way that the observed code degeneration is preserved. We emphasize the advantages of a quaternionic representation of amino acids taking as an example the folding of proteins. With this aim we propose an algorithm to go from the quaternions sequence to the protein three dimensional structure which can be compared with the corresponding experimental one stored at the Protein Data Bank. In our criterion the mathematical representation of the genetic code in terms of quaternions merits to be taken into account because it describes not only most of the known properties of the genetic code but also opens new perspectives that are mainly derived from the close relationship between quaternions and rotations.}

Applying a suitable stress and/or strain with or without a cycle to the scaffolds and cells during the culturing process resides in our ability to generate a suitable mechanical model. Collagen gel is one of the most used scaffolds in vascular tissue engineering, mainly because it is the principal constituent of the extracellular matrix for vascular cells in human. The mechanical modeling of such a material is not a trivial task, mainly for its viscoelastic nature. Computational and experimental methods for developing a suitable model for collagen gels are of primary importance for the field. In this research, we focused on mechanical properties of collagen gels under unconfined compression. First, mechanical viscoelastic models are discussed and framed in the control system theory. Second, models are fitted using system identification. Several models are evaluated and two nonlinear models are proposed: Mooney-Rivlin inspired and Hammerstein models. The results suggest that Mooney-Rivlin and Hammerstein models succeed in describing the mechanical behavior of collagen gels for cyclic tests on scaffolds (with best fitting parameters 58.3\% and 75.8\%, resp.). When Akaike criterion is used, the best is the Mooney-Rivlin inspired model.},

We show that the steady states cannot be properly described since the microstates sampled are not in correspondence with the predicted distributions, suggesting that the postulates of flat measure and ergodicity are, either or both, invalid for this simple realization of a static granular system.

Conductivity appears to be the most sensitive parameter in this respect. Models with ellipse shaped-inclusions are also tested to study their application to modelling bone tissue. Models with ellipses that had an aspect ratio of a/b=1.5 showed relatively good agreement when compared with realistic models of bone tissue.

    Results.
    Under the experimental conditions, S. mutans final concentration, when grown individually, was 5-times that of C. albicans. Contrarily, when both micro-organisms grew together, this ratio was inversed and C. albicans final concentration was even higher than that of S. mutans. When both micro-organisms share the niche, a model including linear competition among one another was best suited to reproduce the experimental observations. The results of this model show that the initial growth rates of both species are positively influenced by their mutual interaction. However, at longer incubation times, C. albicans prevents bacterial growth and achieves concentrations 4-times higher than when grown individually. 
    Conclusions.
    The results suggest that C. albicans biofilm formation could be potentiated by the presence of S. mutans by two mechanisms: synergically at short times and by competition at longer periods. }

Measurements are performed in time domain and data are processed using system identification techniques in continuous and discrete domains. These are very interesting tools for signal processing when working with time domain spectroscopy data. As a validation test for the system identification technique, data are also obtained in the frequency domain. A clear evidence of relaxation processes around 0.2 to 0.4 GHz is shown, which may be due to the movement of polar side chains of the collagen fibers. A strong difference between the dielectric properties of native and demineralized bones was found.

    abstract = {In this paper, estimation of the dielectric properties of layered lossy structure using open-ended coaxial probes is analyzed. Theoretical and empirical exponential approximations of the relaxation process are generalized for two, three and four-layers structures. As measurements are taken in the 10MHz to 1GHz frequency range, a wide frequency spectrum measurement procedure is proposed, providing a fast method to approximate parameters (thickness and dielectric properties) of each layer. Application of the methodology depends on some prior knowledge of the properties of the dielectric layers (i.e. number of layers and approximate values of their thicknesses and permittivities). A linear System Identification method is proposed using time domain measurements to find the corresponding frequency responses. Although these approaches and techniques have been already considered individually, they are combined here, resulting in a novel methodology to process time domain reflectometry data that is robust and numerically well-behaved. Simulations and experimental results in phantom and a biological tissue are provided. Dielectric relaxation is assumed to follow a Debye model, but comments on other parameterizations are also summarized. Experimental frequency validation data are reliable up to 700MHz.}
